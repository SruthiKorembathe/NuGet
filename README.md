# NuGet Client

This is a personal fork of the official NuGet client project hosted on CodePlex at [http://nuget.codeplex.com/](http://nuget.codeplex.com/). Yay open source! If you're looking for the NuGet Gallery project, that's hosted at [https://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery](https://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery)

This is a place where some of us will experiment with new features of NuGet such as building in Mono support. Drew Miller (aka [half-ogre](https://github.com/half-ogre) and I will curate these changes and when they are ready, submit them as pull requests to the official repository.

__The goal is to get these changes into the official repository.__

# Development

If you want to make a contribution to this fork, please branch off the `dev` branch. I will regularly pull in changes from CodePlex into that branch. The `master` branch has one extra commit (the one with this README) that we don't want to submit to the official repository.

_If you have a better idea on how to approach this, let me know._

# Issues

The official issue tracker for NuGet client is at [http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic](http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic).

Remember, this is a personal fork. If you log issues here, they are likely to get ignored unless they're specifically related to the work we're doing in this fork.
